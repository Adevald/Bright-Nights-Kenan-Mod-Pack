"EXPERIMENTAL TANKS TO ENTER FIELD TESTS - A press release yesterday from the"
" Department of Defense has confirmed plans for a series of field tests for a"
" new model of light tank, currently designated the XM7 Tankette.  A major "
"departure from previous armor doctrine, the experimental design features a "
"long-range electric engine and a state-of-the-art autoloader, recently "
"upgraded to fit a 120mm main gun.  Most notable was the confirmation of a "
"one-man crew compartment, with mention of advanced fire control and sensors "
"rendering a commander and gunner unnecessary.  According to General "
"Dabrowski, \"These aren't expected to replace the venerable Abrams, instead "
"we're expecting them to find a new niche for urban warfare.  We're hoping in"
" about a year these will cost a fourth as much as an Abrams to produce while"
" having the same level of firepower.  For the same number of soldiers it'd "
"take to crew one tank, we could have four of these all supporting each "
"other, each monitoring the situation and calling in targets.\""

"ROBOT TANK UNVEILED - A recent press conference has confirmed the latest "
"development in AI-driven defense systems.  Much of the details remain "
"classified, other than the new project having only recently entered early "
"testing.  \"We've refined some of the developments that went into the XM7 "
"Tankette to fit an even more compact package.\" says the update, in "
"reference to the experimental light tank program to see increased production"
" and formal adoption in the coming months.  \"We're exploring uncharted "
"territory with the autonomous fire control, nothing we've put into use so "
"far has handled anything as large as a tank cannon.  Once we have all the "
"kinks worked out we'll proceed with the next wave of trials.  We should have"
" a working dual-core AI ready by the end of the year that can handle both "
"the main gun and an M2 Browning, but for now we're focusing on the main "
"gun.\""

"PATTON TANKS TO BE RESTORED - Amid rumors of war on the horizon and growing "
"unrest, a recent new briefing outlined an emergency plan to restore and "
"rearm several M60 Patton main battle tanks, with roughly two hundred "
"projected to be available across the New England region within the coming "
"weeks.  Officials refused to clarify the purpose of this rearmament program,"
" leaving speculation that the move is an unintentional confirmation of an "
"impending Chinese invasion.  According to an anonymous source within the "
"military, \"They don't expect them to be facing Type 96 or 99 tanks.  "
"They'll likely be used to engage IFVs such as the Type 08 or the Type 15 "
"light tank.\""
